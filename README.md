# 4-Bit-Harvard-Architecture-Computer
The purpose of CHUMP (Cheap Homemade Understandable Minimal Processor) is both to demonstrate how a computer works on the lowest level, and compute simple numbers using standard mathematical operations.
CHUMP is a harvard architecture 4-bit breadboard computer, based off of David Feinberg's design (https://www.el-kalam.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/A-Simple-and-Affordable-TTL-Processor-for-the-Classroom.pdf)

This version of CHUMP has been modified and expanded.
